# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

**Always:**
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Behavior changes

**Exceptions (ask your human partner):**
- Throwaway prototypes
- Generated code
- Configuration files

Thinking "skip TDD just this once"? Stop. That's rationalization.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete

Implement fresh from tests. Period.

## Red-Green-Refactor

```dot
digraph tdd_cycle {
    rankdir=LR;
    red [label="RED\nWrite failing test", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffcccc"];
    verify_red [label="Verify fails\ncorrectly", shape=diamond];
    green [label="GREEN\nMinimal code", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccffcc"];
    verify_green [label="Verify passes\nAll green", shape=diamond];
    refactor [label="REFACTOR\nClean up", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ccccff"];
    next [label="Next", shape=ellipse];

    red -> verify_red;
    verify_red -> green [label="yes"];
    verify_red -> red [label="wrong\nfailure"];
    green -> verify_green;
    verify_green -> refactor [label="yes"];
    verify_green -> green [label="no"];
    refactor -> verify_green [label="stay\ngreen"];
    verify_green -> next;
    next -> red;
}
```

### RED - Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

<Good>
```java
@DisplayName("실패한 작업을 3회 재시도한다")
@Test
void retryOperation_실패시_3회재시도() {
    // given
    AtomicInteger attempts = new AtomicInteger(0);

    // when
    String result = retryService.retryOperation(() -> {
        if (attempts.incrementAndGet() < 3) {
            throw new RuntimeException("fail");
        }
        return "success";
    });

    // then
    assertThat(result).isEqualTo("success");
    assertThat(attempts.get()).isEqualTo(3);
}
```
Clear name, tests real behavior, one thing
</Good>

<Bad>
```java
@Test
void retry_works() {
    // given
    Supplier<String> mockOperation = mock(Supplier.class);
    given(mockOperation.get())
        .willThrow(new RuntimeException())
        .willThrow(new RuntimeException())
        .willReturn("success");

    // when
    retryService.retryOperation(mockOperation);

    // then
    then(mockOperation).should(times(3)).get();
}
```
Vague name, tests mock not code
</Bad>

**Requirements:**
- One behavior
- Clear name (한글 @DisplayName 권장)
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

### Verify RED - Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.**

```bash
./gradlew test --tests RetryServiceTest
```

Confirm:
- Test fails (not errors)
- Failure message is expected
- Fails because feature missing (not typos)

**Test passes?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix test.

**Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly.

### GREEN - Minimal Code

Write simplest code to pass the test.

<Good>
```java
public <T> T retryOperation(Supplier<T> operation) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        try {
            return operation.get();
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            if (i == 2) throw e;
        }
    }
    throw new IllegalStateException("unreachable");
}
```
Just enough to pass
</Good>

<Bad>
```java
public <T> T retryOperation(
        Supplier<T> operation,
        RetryConfig config) {
    // config includes: maxRetries, backoffStrategy, onRetry callback...
    // YAGNI - 필요하지 않은 기능
}
```
Over-engineered
</Bad>

Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test.

### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.**

```bash
./gradlew test --tests RetryServiceTest
```

Confirm:
- Test passes
- Other tests still pass
- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

**Test fails?** Fix code, not test.

**Other tests fail?** Fix now.

### REFACTOR - Clean Up

After green only:
- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers

Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

### Repeat

Next failing test for next feature.

## Good Tests

| Quality | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Minimal** | One thing. "and" in name? Split it. | `@DisplayName("이메일과 도메인과 공백을 검증한다")` |
| **Clear** | Name describes behavior | `@Test void test1()` |
| **Shows intent** | Demonstrates desired API | Obscures what code should do |

## Why Order Matters

**"I'll write tests after to verify it works"**

Tests written after code pass immediately. Passing immediately proves nothing:
- Might test wrong thing
- Might test implementation, not behavior
- Might miss edge cases you forgot
- You never saw it catch the bug

Test-first forces you to see the test fail, proving it actually tests something.

**"I already manually tested all the edge cases"**

Manual testing is ad-hoc. You think you tested everything but:
- No record of what you tested
- Can't re-run when code changes
- Easy to forget cases under pressure
- "It worked when I tried it" ≠ comprehensive

Automated tests are systematic. They run the same way every time.

**"Deleting X hours of work is wasteful"**

Sunk cost fallacy. The time is already gone. Your choice now:
- Delete and rewrite with TDD (X more hours, high confidence)
- Keep it and add tests after (30 min, low confidence, likely bugs)

The "waste" is keeping code you can't trust. Working code without real tests is technical debt.

**"TDD is dogmatic, being pragmatic means adapting"**

TDD IS pragmatic:
- Finds bugs before commit (faster than debugging after)
- Prevents regressions (tests catch breaks immediately)
- Documents behavior (tests show how to use code)
- Enables refactoring (change freely, tests catch breaks)

"Pragmatic" shortcuts = debugging in production = slower.

**"Tests after achieve the same goals - it's spirit not ritual"**

No. Tests-after answer "What does this do?" Tests-first answer "What should this do?"

Tests-after are biased by your implementation. You test what you built, not what's required. You verify remembered edge cases, not discovered ones.

Tests-first force edge case discovery before implementing. Tests-after verify you remembered everything (you didn't).

30 minutes of tests after ≠ TDD. You get coverage, lose proof tests work.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Tests after achieve same goals" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |
| "Already manually tested" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run. |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt. |
| "Keep as reference, write tests first" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |
| "Need to explore first" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD. |
| "Test hard = design unclear" | Listen to test. Hard to test = hard to use. |
| "TDD will slow me down" | TDD faster than debugging. Pragmatic = test-first. |
| "Manual test faster" | Manual doesn't prove edge cases. You'll re-test every change. |
| "Existing code has no tests" | You're improving it. Add tests for existing code. |

## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- Test after implementation
- Test passes immediately
- Can't explain why test failed
- Tests added "later"
- Rationalizing "just this once"
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "It's about spirit not ritual"
- "Keep as reference" or "adapt existing code"
- "Already spent X hours, deleting is wasteful"
- "TDD is dogmatic, I'm being pragmatic"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

## Example: Bug Fix

**Bug:** Empty email accepted

**RED**
```java
@DisplayName("빈 이메일을 거부한다")
@Test
void submitForm_빈이메일_에러반환() {
    // given
    FormRequest request = new FormRequest("");

    // when
    FormResult result = formService.submitForm(request);

    // then
    assertThat(result.getError()).isEqualTo("Email required");
}
```

**Verify RED**
```bash
$ ./gradlew test --tests FormServiceTest.submitForm_빈이메일_에러반환
FAIL: expected "Email required", got null
```

**GREEN**
```java
public FormResult submitForm(FormRequest request) {
    if (request.getEmail() == null || request.getEmail().isBlank()) {
        return FormResult.error("Email required");
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Verify GREEN**
```bash
$ ./gradlew test --tests FormServiceTest
PASS
```

**REFACTOR**
Extract validation for multiple fields if needed.

## Test Class Structure (권장 패턴)

```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class SomeServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private SomePort somePort;  // Port 인터페이스 Mock

    @InjectMocks
    private SomeService someService;

    // ========== 메서드명 테스트 ==========

    @DisplayName("조건이 참이면 기대 결과를 반환한다")
    @Test
    void methodName_조건_기대결과() {
        // given
        SomeInput input = new SomeInput("value");
        given(somePort.findSomething("value")).willReturn(Optional.of(expected));

        // when
        SomeResult result = someService.methodName(input);

        // then
        assertThat(result.getValue()).isEqualTo("expected");
        then(somePort).should().findSomething("value");
    }

    @DisplayName("조건이 거짓이면 예외를 던진다")
    @Test
    void methodName_조건거짓_예외발생() {
        // given
        SomeInput input = new SomeInput("invalid");
        given(somePort.findSomething("invalid")).willReturn(Optional.empty());

        // when & then
        assertThatThrownBy(() -> someService.methodName(input))
                .isInstanceOf(CoreException.class)
                .extracting("errorType")
                .isEqualTo(ErrorType.NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
```

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered

Can't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over.

## When Stuck

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first. Ask your human partner. |
| Test too complicated | Design too complicated. Simplify interface. |
| Must mock everything | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection with Port interfaces. |
| Test setup huge | Extract helpers or use `@BeforeEach`. Still complex? Simplify design. |

## Debugging Integration

Bug found? Write failing test reproducing it. Follow TDD cycle. Test proves fix and prevents regression.

Never fix bugs without a test.

## Testing Anti-Patterns

When adding mocks or test utilities, read @testing-anti-patterns.md to avoid common pitfalls:
- Testing mock behavior instead of real behavior
- Adding test-only methods to production classes
- Mocking without understanding dependencies

## Final Rule

```
Production code → test exists and failed first
Otherwise → not TDD
```

No exceptions without your human partner's permission.
